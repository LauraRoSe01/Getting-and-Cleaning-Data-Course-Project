# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## by Laura Robledo 

  This completes the final project for CourseraÂ´s **[Getting and Cleaning Data Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning)**         offered by John Hopkings University.
  
  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
  
  The data used can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Objectives

To create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
  1. Merges the **training** and the **test** sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the **mean and standard deviation** for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
  ## Contents
  * run_analysis.R - code to reach objectives as above
  * CodeBook.md - code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations
